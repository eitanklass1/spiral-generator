# Spiral Generator

## Overview
This project is a Spiral Generator written in Java, which prompts the user for inputs and generates a visual spiral pattern based on the provided values. The program runs in the console, asking the user to enter:

1. The length of the initial (smallest) segment in the spiral.
2. The number of line segments to display in the spiral.

The goal is to create a simple spiral pattern where each subsequent segment increases in length. The console application ensures that valid input is provided and checks for positive values.

As I developed this project, I took the opportunity to learn about unit testing in Java, which is crucial for ensuring the program functions correctly.
